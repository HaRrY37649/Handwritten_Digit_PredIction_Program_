# Handwritten_Digit_PredIction_Program_
The Handwritten_Digit_Prediction_Program uses a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9). It preprocesses image data, trains the MLP model, and predicts digits with high accuracy. Key technologies include Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and NumPy. Applications range from postal code recognition to form processing.
